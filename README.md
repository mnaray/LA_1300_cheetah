# voci_bot

This is a group project we worked on together.
It's for studying vocabulary in basically any language.
You can insert the words you would like to learn into a .csv-file (csv --> comma seperated values)
The programme splits up the .csv into two different arrays and then matches the indexes of those to quiz you about the stored words.
